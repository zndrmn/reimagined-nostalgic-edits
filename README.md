# Rethinking Voxels
Hello!

You are looking at rethinking-voxels, a minecraft shaderpack. It is an edited version of Complementary Reimagined, and it follows the same visual style, but it also has coloured lights with ray-traced shadows and more VL.

## How to Install

To install this shaderpack, you need to have minecraft 1.19.2 or later (older versions may work, but are unsupported), and a shader loader (either [Iris](https://irisshaders.net) (recommended) or [OptiFine](https://optifine.net)). Please do not report bugs that occur when running the shaderpack on testing versions of either shader loader.

Once you have a shader loader installed, you can either clone this repository into your shaderpacks folder, or download it from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/shader/rethinking-voxels)

you can find your shaderpacks folder by opening minecraft with Iris or OptiFine installed, navigating to `Options` -> `Video Settings` -> `Shader Packs` -> `Open Shader Pack Folder`. If you are using Iris, you can also drag-and-drop the zip file in the shader selection menu to install it.

## Credits

First and foremost, I would like to thank EminGT for creating Complementary Reimagined and allowing me to use it as the base for this shaderpack. Most of the work in this shader comes from them.

zndrmn has helped me with choosing default light colours and organising their settings screen.
